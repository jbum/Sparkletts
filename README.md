Sparkletts - Sample OpenGL Kaleidoscope code

This code is intended to simulate the effect of a 2-mirror kaleidscope, with a fluid-filled object cell whose contents
are affected by gravity.

In the early 2000s I made a number of kaleidoscope screensaversb based on the framework used here.

The basic idea is to keep the code for the object cell separate from the code that handles the mirror reflections,
so that different object cells can be swapped in.
